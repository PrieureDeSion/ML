      <p>I took up the Machine Learning course offered by Andrew NG through <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> in the session May 16, 2016 to August 8, 2016. This page is a documentation of the course, along with the Assignments submitted for evaluation. I always found the idea of making a system <strong><em>learn</em></strong> from its experiences, like humans, very fascinating. Also, ML was introduced to me as a good way to implement my programming knowledge by putting it to some serious use. My motivation for taking up the course (apart from the fact that it's <em>cool</em>) was to get acquainted with scientific computation methods and understand the Math behind "teaching" machines how to think! Also, being a Marvel fan, writing my own neural network had always been on my mind(JARVIS|Iron Man reference).</p>

<p>The first week starts just like you'd expect it to. An introduction to Machine Learning, and it's two broad categories - Supervised and Unsupervised Learning - is given along with common forms of both. The lecturer does no delay in introducing to the real matter of ML, as he starts off by introducing the concept of Linear Regression. The first look at Cost Function and the idea of minimizing the cost turns out to be an interesting one, which </p>
